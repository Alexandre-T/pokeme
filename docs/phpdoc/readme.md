Phpdoc
===================
Phpdoc has been removed from this directory.
You can now create phpdoc by typing 
```
$ phpdoc
```
Because of phpdoc.dist.xml configuration file, documentation will be generated in this directory.

If you want to change configuration, do NOT edit phpdoc.dist.xml file ! Simply, create a new phpdoc.xml file and edit it.

```
$ cp phpdoc.dist.xml phpdoc.xml
```
